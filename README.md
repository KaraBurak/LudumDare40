## WizardClash
This is a 1vs1 game, where both players control a Wizard.
You have to knock the other player offstage by shooting at him.
The more times you got hit the bigger is the knockback.
There are upgrades which are good in the beginning, but the more upgrades you take the more debuffs your character gets.
If you hit an enemy while having an upgrade he gets debuffs too.
You have to figure out in what point of the game you want to get away from the upgrades.
